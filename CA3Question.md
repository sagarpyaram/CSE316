CSE316 Project
If a teacher is being served at the food mess and during the period when he
is being served, another teacher comes, then that teacher would get the
service (food) next. This process might continue leading to increase in
waiting time of students to get food. Propose an algorithm and implement
it using a C program to ensure average waiting time of students is
minimized and that students do not get starved.
